### Counting and classfication 

#### Notes

Analysis of proportion throw away information compared to count, becuase we lose the sample size information, eg 10/20 == 1/2 

Two most common count regressions: 

      1) Binomial regression
      2) Poisson regression: a binomial model with a very large max but with a very small probability per trial. 


#### Binomial regression 
!(Binomial model)[]

y is the observed success count, p is the probability any particular "trial" is a success, and n is the number of trials. 

#### chimpanzees prosocial experiment eg 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(rethinking)
data("chimpanzees")
d <- chimpanzees
d %>% head()
```

math form of the model 

L indicates pulled_left, P indicates
