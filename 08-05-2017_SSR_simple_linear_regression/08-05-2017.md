### sum of square 

sum of square (R square explans how the model fit, low values of R squre indicate that the model is not adequate, however, high values of R square don't mean that the model is adequate.)

### simple linear regression assumption:
linearity, indepdence, normality, equal variance of residual 

```r
# plot of residuals VS. fitted values curvatures, heteroscendasticity? 
plot(fit1$fitted.values, fit1$residuals)
```

```r
# plot of residuals VS. quantiles of a normal distribution, normality? 
qqnorm(fit1$residuals)
```

Sometimes variance of y is not constant across the range of x (heteroscedasticity), Little effect on point estimates but variance estimates will be incorrect, This affects confidence intervals and p-values. 

To account for heteroscedasticity we can, we can
      
* use robust standard error
      
* transform the data
      
* Fit a model that does not assume constant variance (GLM)
      
Some reasons for using data transformations
      
* Original data suggest nonlinearity
      
* Equal variance assumption violated
      
* Normality assumption violated
